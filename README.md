BUGS: (sorted by class)
  DFS:
  BFS:
    - Needs to be tested with five_letter_words.txt still
    - Otherwise should be good
  Main:
  Ladder:
  

TODO:
0. Create some Try/Catch for DFS to avoid StackOverflow
1. Create JUnit Test cases for BFS & DFS
2. Fully Test the "short_dict.txt" dictionary. Make sure that every combination works as expected (DFS good)(BFS good)
3. Test Fringe Cases
  a. Start and End word are the same word (DFS good)(BFS good)
  b. One Word is not in the dictionary
  c. Input word is not 5 letters long

5. Change comparisons to InvariantCultureIgnoreCase or convert all inputs to the same case


REQUIREMENTS:
2. One Scanner object connected to keyboard within main()
3. 5 methods in main
	- initialize
	- parse
	- getWordLadderDFS 
	- getWordLadderBFS
	- printLadder
4. 
=======
4. Clean up main to accept Keyboard Inputs rather than randomly generated inputs
5. Parce needs to be written
6. PDF and testing plans and such need to be written up
